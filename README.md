## 2. Problem Statement

### Chosen Problem: Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution

**Problem Analysis:**
In urban and semi-urban areas across India, citizens face numerous civic issues daily - from potholes and broken streetlights to garbage dumps and water supply problems. The current system for reporting these issues is fragmented, inefficient, and lacks transparency. Citizens often don't know where to report issues, and when they do, there's no way to track progress or ensure accountability.

Key challenges include:
- No centralized platform for issue reporting
- Lack of transparency in resolution process
- Poor communication between citizens and authorities
- No visual evidence support for reported issues
- Difficulty in tracking issue status and progress
- Geographic limitations in identifying nearby issues

**Target Audience:**
- **Primary Users:** Citizens aged 18-65 who experience civic issues
- **Secondary Users:** Municipal authorities, civic administrators, and local government officials
- **Geographic Focus:** Urban and semi-urban areas with smartphone penetration
